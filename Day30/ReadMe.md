## üìå Overview
This log summarizes the key concepts I studied and implemented around **Dependency Injection (DI)**, **Inversion of Control (IoC)**, and **Proxy Classes**‚Äîcore principles widely used in frameworks like Spring Boot.

## üß† Key Concepts

### 1. Inversion of Control (IoC)
- A design principle that delegates control of object creation to a container or framework.
- Promotes **loose coupling**, **modularity**, and **testability**.
- The container (like the Spring IoC container) manages object lifecycles and dependencies.

### 2. Dependency Injection (DI)
- A method of implementing IoC where dependencies are injected into a class from an external source.
- Explored:
  - **Constructor Injection**
  - **Setter Injection**
  - **Field Injection**

#### ‚úÖ Interface Injection Insight
- When injecting by interface, the framework locates and injects the appropriate implementation **at runtime**.
- This is handled automatically by Spring using its bean resolution mechanism.
- It enables high flexibility and abstraction, making the application more maintainable.

### 3. Benefits of DI and IoC
- Reduces tight coupling between components.
- Enhances unit testability with mocks/stubs.
- Simplifies maintenance and improves code reusability.

### 4. Proxy Classes
- Proxies are wrapper classes that add additional behavior (e.g., logging, transactions) around method calls.
- Spring uses:
  - **JDK Dynamic Proxies** for interfaces.
  - **CGLIB Proxies** for concrete classes.
- Often used in **AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)** for method interception.

## üîß Practical Work
- Built and tested Spring Boot examples implementing DI via constructor, setter, and field injection.
- Observed how Spring resolves interface implementations at runtime.
- Configured AOP and studied how proxies modify runtime behavior without touching business logic.

## üìù Conclusion
Understanding how IoC and DI work, especially the ability of Spring to inject interface implementations dynamically at runtime, has enhanced my confidence in building flexible and scalable applications. The use of proxy classes in Spring further demonstrated how powerful abstraction and runtime enhancement can be when designing modern software systems.
