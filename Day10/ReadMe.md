<h1>Spring Security</h1>
<h3>
‚úÖ Spring Security ‚Äì Professional Summary (Internship-Ready)
Spring Security is a powerful and customizable authentication and access control framework for Java applications, particularly those built using the Spring Framework. It is the de facto standard for securing Spring-based applications.
</h3>
<h3>
üîê Key Concepts:</br>
Authentication: Verifies the identity of a user (e.g., login with username and password)</br>
Authorization: Determines access rights based on user roles and privileges</br>
Filters & Interceptors: Built on a robust filter chain for pre- and post-processing of HTTP requests</br>
SecurityContext: Stores security-related information of the current user session</br>
CSRF Protection: Safeguards against cross-site request forgery attacks</br>
Method Security: Secures methods using annotations like @PreAuthorize, @Secured</br>
Password Encoding: Implements password hashing using tools like BCryptPasswordEncoder</br>
</h3>

<h3>

üîß Common Features Used in Projects:</br>
Form-based login and logout handling</br>
Role-based access control with @PreAuthorize, @RolesAllowed</br>
Integration with databases for user details via UserDetailsService</br>
Secure API endpoints using JWT (JSON Web Token) or OAuth2</br>
Exception handling and custom access denied handlers</br>
Stateless session management for RESTful APIs</br>
