# ðŸ©º Appointment System Project

A web-based **Appointment Booking System** developed using **Spring Boot**, focused on clean architecture, maintainable code, and modern web development practices.

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Applied SOLID Principles
- Refactored the project structure by applying **Single Responsibility**, **Open/Closed**, **Liskov Substitution**, **Interface Segregation**, and **Dependency Inversion** principles.
- Improved code modularity, testability, and scalability.

### 2. Explored Custom Annotations
- Created and used **custom annotations** for reusable logic, such as marking methods that require specific checks (e.g., authorization).
- Enhanced code readability by abstracting repetitive logic into annotations.

### 3. Explored Interceptors
- Implemented **Spring Interceptors** to handle cross-cutting concerns like:
  - Logging incoming requests
  - Validating request headers or parameters
  - Checking authentication or user roles
- Ensured separation of business logic and infrastructure concerns.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Java 23**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring MVC**
- **Thymeleaf** (Frontend templating engine)
- **MySQL** (Database)
- **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication)
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (for UI components)

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Implemented

- Clean, layered architecture: Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository
- Authentication and Authorization using JWT
- Custom annotations for modular logic
- Interceptors for request preprocessing
- Pagination, modal-based booking UI, and a modern layout
