  </li>

  <li><strong>Create Lab Test</strong><br>
      Use the <strong>LabTest Controller</strong> to create lab test entries. This endpoint is also <strong>public during testing</strong>.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Create Diagnostic Center</strong><br>
      Use the <strong>Diagnostic Controller</strong> to add diagnostic center data. Like the others, this is <strong>publicly accessible for testing</strong>.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Create User</strong><br>
      Register a new user either via the <strong>UserAuthController</strong> or through the <strong>frontend registration page</strong>.
